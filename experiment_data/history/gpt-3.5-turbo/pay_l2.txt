Question: `Question: What is the root cause and a possible solution for this alert:
`{
    "labels": {
        "alertname": "PaymentServiceOverloaded",
        "severity": "critical",
        "pod": "paymentsvc-main-0",
        "namespace": "test-002"
    },
    "annotations": {
        "description": "PaymentService in namespace test-001 is using 70% of CPU."
    },
    "activeAt": "2024-02-05T22:57:37.332298Z"
}``
Thought: To find the root cause and a possible solution, I need to find the logs of the pod 'paymentsvc-main-0' in the namespace 'test-002'.

t=2024-02-05T22:57:37.332298Z level=WARN msg="CPU over 45%."
Thought: Looking at the logs, I can see that the CPU usage of the payment service has increased to 30% and then to 45%. The log entry at t=2024-02-05T22:40:37.332298Z indicates that there might be a problem reaching the external provider PayYay, and the CPU usage might be increasing as a result. This could be the root cause of the high CPU usage.

Thought: The pod 'userauthsvc-main-0' in the namespace 'test-002' is failed and has restarted 5 times. This might be the root cause of the high CPU usage.

Thought: The logs of the userauthsvc-main-0 pod show that there are problems accessing the OAuth-Provider and loading cached user data. This could be causing high CPU usage in the payment service. The root cause of the high CPU usage might be the failed userauthsvc-main-0 pod.
