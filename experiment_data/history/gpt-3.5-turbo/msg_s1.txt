Question: `Question: What is the root cause and a possible solution for this alert:
`{
    "labels": {
        "alertname": "MessagesBelowAverage",
        "severity": "critical",
        "pod": "messengersvc-main-0",
        "namespace": "test-004"
    },

    },
    "activeAt": "2024-02-05T21:37:21.336132Z"
}``
Thought: To find the root cause and possible solution for this alert, I need to analyze the logs of the pod 'messengersvc-main-0' in the namespace 'test-004'.

Thought: Looking at the logs of the playerstatssvc pod, I can see that there was a change in the message-send-policy at t=2024-02-06T04:31:45.336485Z. This change might have affected the number of messages sent to the messengersvc pod. The root cause might be related to this configuration change.

Thought: Looking at the logs of the playerstatssvc pod, there are no apparent issues or configuration changes that could explain the decrease in messages received by the messengersvc pod. The root cause of the alert might be in another component or service. I will check the logs of the paymentsvc pod to gather more information.
