Question: `Question: What is the root cause and a possible solution for this alert:
`{
    "labels": {
        "alertname": "BugTicketServiceOverloaded",
        "severity": "critical",
        "pod": "bugticketsvc-main-0",
        "namespace": "test-000"
    },
    "annotations": {
        "description": "BugTicketservice in namespace test-000 is using 65% of CPU."
    },
    "activeAt": "2024-02-04T19:22:47.862156Z"
}``
Thought: To find the root cause and a possible solution, I need to find the logs of the pod 'bugticketsvc-main-0' in the namespace 'test-000'.

Thought: Looking at the logs, I can see that there are new open tickets for tag 'paymentsvc' and some tickets have been resolved for tag 'client'. There are also tickets that have not been resolved for more than 3 days for tag 'launcher'. It seems there might be an issue with the ticket handling in the paymentsvc pod or the launcher pod.

Thought: The paymentsvc pod in the test-000 namespace is in a failed state. This might be the root cause of the BugTicketServiceOverloaded alert.

Thought: Looking at the logs of the paymentsvc pod in the test-000 namespace, I can see that the payment processing exceeded the allowed time for the last 100 transactions. This might be the root cause of the BugTicketServiceOverloaded alert.

Thought: The paymentsvc pod in the test-000 namespace is in a failed state and the logs indicate that the payment processing exceeded the allowed time for the last 100 transactions. This is likely the root cause of the BugTicketServiceOverloaded alert.
