Question: `Question: What is the root cause and a possible solution for this alert:
`{
    "labels": {
        "alertname": "TooManyPlayersAffected",
        "severity": "critical",
        "pod": "playerstatssvc-main-0",
        "namespace": "test-004"
    },
    "annotations": {
        "description": "Too many players affected by configuration change."
    },
    "activeAt": "2024-02-06T04:45:45.336485Z"
}``
Thought: To find the root cause and a possible solution, I need to find the logs of the pod 'playerstatssvc-main-0' in the namespace 'test-004'.

Thought: Looking at the logs, I can see that there was a configuration change at t=2024-02-06T04:31:45.336485Z and it mentions that 1000000 players will be affected. This might be the root cause of the alert. To confirm, I need to check the logs of other pods to see if there were any issues or errors after the configuration change.

The possible solution could be to check if the configuration change was intentional and if it is causing any issues for the players.
