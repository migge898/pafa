Question: `Question: What is the root cause and a possible solution for this alert:
`{
    "labels": {
        "alertname": "PlayerStatsMissing",
        "severity": "critical",
        "pod": "playerstatssvc-main-0",
        "namespace": "test-002"
    },
    "annotations": {
        "description": "Failed to load some statistics."
    },
    "activeAt": "2024-02-06T10:33:38.333018Z"
}``
Thought: To find the root cause and a possible solution, I need to find the logs of the pod 'playerstatssvc-main-0' in the namespace 'test-002'.
