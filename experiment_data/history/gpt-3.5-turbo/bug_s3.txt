Question: `Question: What is the root cause and a possible solution for this alert:
`{
    "labels": {
        "alertname": "BugTicketServiceOverloaded3",
        "severity": "critical",
        "pod": "bugticketsvc-main-0",
        "namespace": "test-002"
    },
    "annotations": {
        "description": "BugTicketservice in namespace test-002 is using 90% of CPU."
    },
    "activeAt": "2024-02-06T09:40:06.331935Z"
}``
Thought: To find the root cause and a possible solution, I need to find the logs of the pod 'bugticketsvc-main-0' in the namespace 'test-002'.

Thought: Looking at the logs, I can see that there are many new open tickets for tag 'userauthsvc' and the CPU usage goes higher shortly after. Therefore, there might be a problem with the userauthsvc pod. I will look at the pods to see if there is any abnormal behavior.

Thought: The userauthsvc-main-0 pod has failed 5 times and has 0 out of 7 containers ready. This might be the problematic userauthsvc pod. I will examine its logs.

Thought: Looking at the logs of the userauthsvc-main-0 pod, I can see that there are warnings about the OAuth-Provider not being available and problems with logging in from different regions. These issues might be causing high CPU usage in the bugticketsvc-main-0 pod.

Thought: The userauthsvc-main-0 pod is in a failed state with 0 out of 7 containers ready. The logs of this pod indicate issues with the OAuth-Provider and problems with logging in from different regions. This might be the root cause of the high CPU usage in the bugticketsvc-main-0 pod.
