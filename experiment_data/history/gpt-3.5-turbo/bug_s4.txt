Question: `Question: What is the root cause and a possible solution for this alert:
`{
    "labels": {
        "alertname": "TicketCountHigh3",
        "severity": "critical",
        "pod": "bugticketsvc-main-0",

    },
    "activeAt": "2024-02-06T08:40:06.331935Z"
}``
Thought: To find the root cause and a possible solution, I need to find the logs of the pod 'bugticketsvc-main-0' in the namespace 'test-003'.

Thought: Looking at the logs, I can see that there are multiple instances of new open tickets for the tag 'messengerscv'. The CPU usage is also mentioned, indicating a possible correlation between the high number of tickets and increased CPU usage. The root cause might involve the messengersvc pod.

The logs indicate that some tickets have been resolved and assigned, but there is no indication of any abnormalities or errors. The root cause may be related to another service or pod.
