Thought: Looking at the logs, it can be seen that the same message 'Prepare for the event, warriors!' has been broadcasted multiple times. The alert indicates that more than 5 broadcasts with the same message were sent in the last 30 minutes. This might indicate that there is a spamming issue in the messengersvc pod.
