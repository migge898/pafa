Question: `Question: What is the root cause and a possible solution for this alert:
`{
    "labels": {
        "alertname": "StatsCheckBelowAverage",
        "severity": "critical",
        "pod": "playerstatssvc-main-1",
        "namespace": "test-002"
    },
    "annotations": {
        "description": "Users checked stats below 30% of the average."
    },
    "activeAt": "2024-02-06T06:18:17.333135Z"
}``
Thought: To find the root cause and a possible solution, I need to find the logs of the pod 'playerstatssvc-main-1' in the namespace 'test-002'.

t=2024-02-06T06:18:17.333135Z level=INFO msg="Player with id: 7295 has been banned."
Thought: Looking at the logs, there seems to be a player with id 7295 getting banned multiple times. This might be related to the decrease in the number of players checking stats in the last few minutes. However, it's unclear why this would result in the average stats check being below 30%. I need to gather more information.

Thought: The pod playerstatssvc-main-2 has failed and was restarted. This might be related to the decrease in the number of players checking stats. I should check its logs.

Thought: Looking at the logs of playerstatssvc-main-2, it seems that there was a change in the configuration and the pod is not responding. This might be the root cause of the decrease in the number of players checking stats. The solution might be to restart the pod.
Final Answer: True
