Question: `Question: What is the root cause and a possible solution for this alert:
`{
    "labels": {
        "alertname": "StatsCheckBelowAverage",
        "severity": "critical",
        "pod": "playerstatssvc-main-1",

}``
Thought: To understand why the 'Users checked stats are below 30% of the average', I need to first analyze the logs of the 'playerstatssvc-main-1' pod in the 'test-002' namespace to look for any anomalies or error messages that might explain the sudden drop in usage.

Thought: Seeing multiple instances where a player has been banned, alongside a noticeable decrease in the number of players checking stats, suggests a potential correlation. It is peculiar to note the warning about a drastic reduction in new authentication tokens. A decrease in token issuance could explain the lower stats check rate, as fewer new users might be getting authenticated and thus not contributing to stats checks. To further investigate the cause of the reduced token issuance, it may be useful to examine the logs of the authentication service responsible for token generation.

t=2024-02-06T03:58:49.332543Z level=WARN msg="East-Asia experiencing problems logging in."
Thought: Based on the logs from both `playerstatssvc-main-1` and `userauthsvc-main-0`, it appears the decrease in players checking stats correlates with issues in the authentication process, notably after the cache-service was switched to offline. Players in West-Europe and East-Asia are experiencing login issues, likely contributing to the decrease in stats checks due to fewer authenticated sessions. The root cause seems to be the caching service being offline, affecting the OAuth-provider's ability to function properly. Turning the cache-service back online might solve the authentication issues, consequently raising the number of players checking their stats.
Action: get_logs[namespace=test-002, pod=cache-svc-main-0]
Observation:
[ERR] Pod cache-svc-main-0 not found in namespace test-002. Check if the provided namespace is correct.
Thought: Given the log indicating the cache-service was switched to offline in the userauthsvc-main-0 pod, but unable to find logs for 'cache-svc-main-0', it's possible there could be a misconfiguration or misunderstanding. It's essential to reassess the situation, verify the correct pod name for the cache service, or determine if another service might be responsible for this offline status that we need to investigate further.

Thought: Upon examining the pods list in 'test-002', it seems that there's no pod directly named after the cache service, which explains why the logs for 'cache-svc-main-0' could not be found. Additionally, the 'userauthsvc-main-0' pod has failed, which correlates with the authentication issues observed. This failure might be directly linked to the cache-service being offline, as hinted in the logs. The action to take might involve diagnosing the cause of the 'userauthsvc-main-0' failure to understand how it's related to the caching issue.
