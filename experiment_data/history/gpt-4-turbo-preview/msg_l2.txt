Question: `Question: What is the root cause and a possible solution for this alert:
`{
    "labels": {
        "alertname": "MessageSpam",
        "severity": "critical",
        "pod": "messengersvc-main-1",
        "namespace": "test-003"
    },
    "annotations": {
        "description": "More than 5 broadcasts with the same message were sent in last 30 minutes."
    },
    "activeAt": "2024-02-06T08:10:02.334472Z"
}``
Thought: To find the root cause and a possible solution for the alert 'MessageSpam,' I need to check the logs of the pod 'messengersvc-main-1' in the namespace 'test-003'. This will help understand why the same message was broadcasted multiple times.

Thought: The log entries indicate there was a configuration change at 2024-02-06T07:45:02.334472Z with 'config: changed brodcast-resend to -1.' This might have caused the same message to be broadcasted multiple times as seen from the subsequent log entries. To find a solution, we need to understand what the 'broadcast-resend' configuration does.

Thought: The repeated action of getting logs from the same pod and namespace does not provide new information regarding what the configuration 'broadcast-resend' does and how to adjust it for a possible solution. I need to look into the logs of other related pods which might have interactions or dependencies with 'messengersvc-main-1' to find any additional information on managing or configuring 'broadcast-resend'.

Thought: Given the configuration change related to 'broadcast-resend' seemed to trigger the repeated message broadcast issue, it's plausible that a service responsible for configurations or messaging system parameters, like the userauthsvc, might have logs containing details on how to adjust or correct this setting. Exploring the logs of the 'userauthsvc-main-0' pod, which has experienced a restart (possibly indicating an issue or change), could yield valuable insights.

Thought: The logs from 'userauthsvc-main-0' indicate issues related to SSL/TLS certificate expiration and user management such as password changes and resets, but do not provide direct insight on how to adjust the 'broadcast-resend' setting for the 'messengersvc-main-1'. Thus, it seems that the solution to the 'MessageSpam' alert does not directly involve the 'userauthsvc-main-0' pod. The most actionable clue still points to the configuration change in 'messengersvc-main-1'. A possible solution could involve adjusting or reversing the 'broadcast-resend' configuration to an appropriate value that prevents spam.
