Question: `Question: What is the root cause and a possible solution for this alert:
`{
    "labels": {
        "alertname": "MessagesBelowAverage",
        "severity": "critical",
        "pod": "messengersvc-main-0",

    },
    "activeAt": "2024-02-05T21:37:21.336132Z"
}``
Thought: To understand why the messenger service is receiving messages below 30% of the average, I should first check the logs of the affected pod ('messengersvc-main-0' in the 'test-004' namespace) to look for any errors, warnings, or other indicators of what might be causing this issue.

Thought: The warning at t=2024-02-05T21:30:21.336132Z about receiving 100 less messages than average from 'playerstatssvc', followed by a more significant decrease to 200 less messages at t=2024-02-05T21:36:21.336132Z suggests a potential issue with 'playerstatssvc'. To further investigate, it would be prudent to examine the logs of 'playerstatssvc-main-0' in the 'test-004' namespace to see if there are any indications of problems that could be causing the reduced message flow.

Thought: The log indicating a change in the 'message-send-policy' to 500 days at t=2024-02-06T04:31:45.336485Z suggests a potential root cause for the decreased message flow to 'messengersvc-main-0'. This configuration change likely reduced the number of players eligible to send messages drastically, which could have directly impacted the amount of messages being processed by 'messengersvc-main-0'. To find a solution, it may involve reverting this change or adjusting the policy to a more reasonable timeframe that doesn't hinder player engagement. However, further confirmation is needed to ensure this is the exact root cause and that reverting this change is a viable solution.

Thought: Confirming that 'playerstatssvc-main-0' is running without restarts, alongside other services, implies the issue may not be related to pod failures or crashes but likely stems from the recent policy change. Therefore, a possible solution involves revising or reverting the 'message-send-policy' to ensure a more inclusive criteria that does not drastically limit player interactions. Before suggesting this, it's necessary to confirm if any actions were taken post-policy change to address its impacts.

Thought: The logs from 'playerstatssvc-main-0' confirm the recent policy change, which likely caused the decrease in message flow observed in 'messengersvc-main-0'. Given this evidence, a viable solution would involve modifying or reverting the 'message-send-policy' to a less restrictive timeframe, allowing more players to participate and increasing message volume. There's no indication of further actions taken post-policy implementation that would mitigate its impact. It’s crucial to collaborate with the stakeholders to assess the feasibility and potential impacts of reversing or adjusting this policy.
