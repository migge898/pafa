Question: `Question: What is the root cause and a possible solution for this alert:
`{
    "labels": {
        "alertname": "NoMessagesFromRegion",
        "severity": "critical",
        "pod": "messengersvc-main-2",
        "namespace": "test-003"
    },
    "annotations": {
        "description": "No messages received from region: America-North in last 60 minutes."
    },
    "activeAt": "2024-02-06T03:32:32.334591Z"
}``
Thought: To find the root cause and a possible solution, I need to find the logs of the pod "messengersvc-main-2" in the namespace "test-003".

Thought: The logs show a progressive decline in receiving messages from the region: America-North, escalating from an alert about not receiving messages for 10 minutes to 30 minutes, and later, a warning about problems receiving some messages from `userauthsvc`. This suggests a potential issue with the interaction between `messengersvc-main-2` and the `userauthsvc` service. Checking the `userauthsvc` pod logs in the same namespace may provide further insight.

t=2024-02-05T23:47:53.334234Z level=INFO msg="America-North: 10000 users were logged out due to wrong certificates."
Thought: The logs from `userauthsvc-main-0` indicate an SSL/TLS configuration issue specifically for the region America-North, leading to mass user logouts. This likely caused the messaging service to not receive any messages from the affected region, as users were unable to authenticate or stay logged in due to expired or wrong certificates. The root cause of the alert seems to be the incorrect SSL/TLS certificate configuration for America-North in the `userauthsvc` service.
Final Answer: True
