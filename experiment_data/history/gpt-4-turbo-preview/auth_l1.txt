Question: `Question: What is the root cause and a possible solution for this alert:
`{
    "labels": {
        "alertname": "AuthServiceDownForRegion",
        "severity": "critical",
        "pod": "userauthsvc-main-0",
        "namespace": "test-003"
    },
    "annotations": {
        "description": "More than 20000 users of America-North cannot login."
    },
    "activeAt": "2024-02-05T23:45:53.334234Z"
}``
Thought: To address the critical alert stating that the AuthService is down for North American users, I'll first check the logs of the specified pod ('userauthsvc-main-0' in the 'test-003' namespace) to look for any error messages or anomalies that occurred before the alert was active. This could provide insights into why users are unable to login.
Action: get_logs[namespace=test-003, pod=userauthsvc-main-0]

Thought: The logs indicate a change to the SSL/TLS expiration date that was set incorrectly to 01.01.1970 for the America-North region, followed by warnings about users being logged out due to wrong certificates. This error in setting the SSL/TLS expiration date appears to be the root cause of the service downtime impacting users' ability to log in. The solution would likely involve correcting the SSL/TLS certificate expiration date for the America-North region.
Final Answer: True
